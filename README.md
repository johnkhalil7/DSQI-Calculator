# DSQICalulator

This is a website that will serve as a tool to assist in the calculation of a DSQI, a metric used to evaluate 
a computer program's design structure and the efficiency of its modules.

The user will enter in S-values into the labeled input areas, each having a help button to click on
and assist the user in entering a valid input.

The user can also check the box to use the distinct method or not. If they choose to do so,
the value of D1 on the second page will be set to 1, else it will be set to 0

If invalid values are entered for an s-value, a message will appear and the corresponding
box(es) will be highlighted red.

Upon hitting the next page, the s-values are then converted to d-values

The user will then enter weight values whose sum must equal 100 and press the "Calculate DSQI"
button to calculate DSQI. If invalid weight values are entered, a message will appear and
the corresponding box(es) will be highlighted red

Once the user presses the calculate button, a message will appear displaying the DSQI value
and whether it is above, below, or within the average DSQI value ranage.
